# Compiling HelloWorld.java using javac

### First make sure you have [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed. You can test this by entering:
`javac -version`

into the console.


### Now you need to compile the .java file into bytecode by using the command:
`javac HelloWorld.java`


### To run the compiled code you can now enter:
`java HelloWorld`
